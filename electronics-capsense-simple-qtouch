"This circuit may also be used for QTouchADC, the only difference in the
circuit would be Cs â€“ it is not required when using QTouchADC.
...
â€¢ QTouch requires two processor pins, one optional series resistor (used to
reduce emissions conducted noise) and one capacitor per sensor
â€¢ QTouchADC requires one processor pin and one optional resistor (used to
reduce emissions and conducted noise) per sensor

QTouch proximity sensors are touch keys deliberately made over-sensitive. This can be
accomplished using a combination of the following:
â€¢ Make the sensing electrode larger
â€¢ Increase the value of the sampling capacitor [33;1mCs[;m
â€¢ Decrease the touch detection threshold
â€¢ Reduce ground loading effects
"

Higher [33;1mRsns[;m results in higher sensitivity sensor *I think*.
For long leads (ex. 1.2m), coax cable can be used, with shielding attached to
driven shield, with electrode lead on center conductor
