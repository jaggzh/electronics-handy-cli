		${sect} The Planck-Einstein Relation ${rst}
		The energy ($equ$sym_e$rst) of a photon is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:
		   $equ$sym_e = $sym_h * $sym_nu$rst
		where $equ$sym_h$rst is Planck's constant (${nums}6.626 x 10^-34 ${unit}Js$rst)
		and $equ$sym_nu$rst is the frequency of the photon.

		The frequency ($sym$sym_nu$rst) can be related to the wavelength ($sym$sym_lambda$rst)
		by the speed of light ($sym$sym_c$rst): $equ$sym_nu = $sym_c / $sym_lambda$rst

		Therefore, the energy of a photon can also be written as: $equ$sym_e = ($sym_h * $sym_c) / $sym_lambda$rst

		${sect} Conversion to Electron Volts ${rst}
		The energy calculated from the Planck-Einstein relation is in joules ($equ${unit}J$rst)
		when using SI units. However, it is often more convenient to express
		photon energy in electron volts (${unit}eV$rst).

		${sect} The Simplified Formula ${rst}
		By substituting $sym$sym_h$rst, $sym$sym_c$rst, and the conversion factor from joules to electron volts
		into the equation, and setting $sym$sym_lambda$rst in nanometers (${unit}nm$rst) for practical use, we
		derive a simplified formula: $equ$sym_e (eV) = 1240 / $sym_lambda (nm)$rst

		${sect} Application to LEDs ${rst}
		For LEDs and other semiconductor devices, the energy calculated by this
		formula represents the photon energy corresponding to the band gap of
		the material, which determines the color (wavelength) of the light emitted.
